#### _Description_
	This site uses the concepts of RESTful routing to set up a Bands & Venues web Java application. 
	In this app, Bands are added to play in certain Venues. There are two classes Band and Venue with a many to many relationship. 
	The user can add as many bands and venues as possible, add Bands to Venues and vice versa. 
	The user can select a band to see all the Venues they have played or are going to play at. 
	The user can also select a Venue and see what bands have played or are going to play there. 
	The test application was backed with a Postgres database server (local- see set up instructions) 
	The production application is backed with a Heroku Postgres server (remote- visit site). 
	Restful web pages are routered and rendered through the Spark Framework. 
	Velocity tool is used to create html (with lightweight java code) templates for our Spark routines (get/post etc).
	VelocityTemplateEngine is used as an adapter to add Velocity templates to our Spark routines.	
	The code was designed using Behavoir Driven Development (BDD) testing principles. 
	The unit testing of the backend is done using jUnit. 
	The integration testing of the user interface was done using Selenium Webdriver tests and a FluentLenium Adapter. 
	All testing dependencies were managed using Gradle for the app version with db that runs locally. 
	All production dependencies are managed using Maven for the app version that runs remotely.

#### _Setup/Installation Requirements_
